# random_char_generator

Welcome! For use with DnD this generator pulls from the players handbook for character generation.
The characters made using this tool are in no way optimized and all traits, classes and skills are generated randomly.
Spice up your campaign with a dragonborn rogue with no dexterity and high wisdom.

Probably just use it as inspriation...
